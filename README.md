#### Paths, Files, Filesystems
`sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_profile_path` is the root directory holding the "profiles" of ASCS and ERS. It is generated based on convention and the provided SID. `sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_profile_path_ascs` and `sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_profile_path_ers` are set to it (or overridden), and the respective `profile_file` values are generated based on the particular `_alias_` names and IDs (or overridden).

For each of thing={'ascs', 'ers', 'sapmnt', 'sys', 'trans'}, we create a PCS filesystem resource named `sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fsr_name_<thing>`, which is set sanely, but can be overridden. It mounts `sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fsdevice_<thing>` at `sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_mntdir_<type>` as a filesystem type of `sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fstype_<thing>`.  `_mntdir` is set by convention (but can be overridden), the `device` need to be specified. `fstype` can be specified generally, or per `fstype_<thing>`.

### STONITH fencing
The following variables are common to all fencing devices (except those on hyperscalers)

|                         variable                         |                                              info                                              | required? |
|:--------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------:|
|      sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.name      |                                   Name of the fencing device                                   |    yes    |
|      sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.type      |                                      Fencing device type                                       |   yes *   |
|       sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.ip       |                                IP address of the fencing device                                |    yes    |
|      sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.user      |                           Username to connect to the fencing device                            |    yes    |
|      sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.pwd       |                           Password to connect to the fencing device                            |    yes    |
| sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.pcmk_host_list |                         List of nodes controlled by the fencing device                         |   yes *   |
| sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.password_file  |        Full path/filename to 'password script' to use for fencing device configuration         |    no     |
| sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.pcmk_host_map  |                            Mapping of the hostnames/ip of the nodes                            |   yes*    |
| sap_netweaver_ha_pacemaker_fencing_device.custom_options | Additional options to pass to fence device creation, e.g. "ssl=1 ssl_insecure=1 power_wait=30" |    no     |
 
\* Must provide either a pcmk_host_list or a pcmk_host_map, per https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2619961 for a discussion on host_list vs host_map

This is a list of the most common fencing devices:
 - fence_vmware_soap - VMWare
 - fence_vmware_rest - VMWare
 - fence_ipmilan - IPMI
 - fence_ilo4_ssh - HP ILO
 - fence_rhevm - RHV
 - fence_azure_arm - Azure


 ## TODO and Notes
* Fencing should perhaps be extracted to own role to share with redhat_sap.sap-hana-ha-pacemaker
* Verify drivers other than fence_vmware_rest support passwd_script option
* Support >2 nodes
* Support >2 links
* This remains mostly untested against a range of systems.
* Var docs
* FS paths should match samples from docs
* Is this the right place for Azure LB? (commented out as wasn't going to work, anyway)
* If using clustering, the sap_s4netweaver_deployment is likely going to need /etc/hosts setup, so this is a dupe
* /etc/hosts perhaps should have ansible tags in it, either way, so the several roles can not clobber each other
* Should instance aliases be in /etc/hosts?
* Rename 'ASCS' to 'APP'(?) everywhere if this "works" with more app stacks than ASCS, like the java thing
  *
